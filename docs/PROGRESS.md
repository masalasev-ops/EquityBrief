# PROGRESS.md

The record of what was built, what was measured, and what is carried. Append only. A correction is a new dated entry naming what it corrects, never an edit to an earlier one.

**Which checkpoint the build is on is the furthest checkpoint this file records.** The one to build next is the checkpoint after it in `BUILD_PLAN.md`.

An entry that belongs to a checkpoint without saying that checkpoint has landed opens with **"Not a checkpoint entry"**. A phase-planning pass is the usual case.

## Entry format

```
### <checkpoint> - <what it built>            YYYY-MM-DD
Built:      what exists now that did not before
Measured:   figures, each naming the population it was computed over
Tests:      the count after tools/ci
Carried:    obligations created here, each naming a due point BUILD_PLAN also has
Notes:      anything a later session would otherwise have to rediscover
```

**Every figure states the population it was computed over, in the same breath.** A figure over a mixed population is not stated at all. A count over listed names only is a figure over the wrong population, because a listing row exists for every name.

**A checkpoint that amended its own done condition says so here, in those words.**

### 0.0 - the repository, and eight defects the first corpus check found      2026-09-06
Built:      a git repository on `main`, the corpus committed unedited as its first commit, and
            branch `phase-0-repair` carrying the repairs. `ci.yml` moved from the root to
            `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, where Actions actually reads it. `global.json` and
            `src/Directory.Build.props` created. Checkpoint 0.0 added to `BUILD_PLAN.md`,
            `banned-prose` added to the Checks roster.
Measured:   over the 8 corpus documents, 13 decision citations, 0 unresolved and 0 resolving
            into "Previously decided". Over `DECISIONS.md`, 83 decision names, 7 of them
            previously decided, 0 duplicated, 0 carrying terminal punctuation. Over the 14
            tracked files, 0 unnamed by the layout block, 1 occurrence of the banned string
            and it is the exempt line, and 0 em dashes. Over `CHANGELOG.md`, 11 entries, 10
            naming a defect and 1 naming a decision, 0 naming neither. Over the 10 commits on
            this branch, 4 deleted a line from a spec and all 4 changed `CHANGELOG.md`.
Tests:      none. `tools/ci.*` does not exist until 0.4, so every figure above was swept by
            hand and none of it is guarded yet. A repeat of this sweep is what 0.4 automates.
Carried:    the citation placeholder in `BUILD_PLAN.md`'s carried obligations table, due at
            0.4, recorded as a row in that table.
Notes:      the workflow at the repository root was the sharpest of the eight. Actions reads
            workflows from `.github/workflows` and nowhere else, so the matrix job and the
            Linux case-sensitivity job had never run, which left done condition 5,
            `two-platform` and the instrument the Checks section claims for `path-casing` all
            unsatisfied with nothing reporting it. Neither is proved yet: no push has run the
            workflow, so 0.1 is the first checkpoint that will see either runner go green.
            `.claude/` is gitignored and untracked. It is per-machine harness state, not a
            corpus document, and the layout block does not name it.

### Correction to the 0.0 entry above - a ninth defect      2026-09-06
Corrects:   the entry above says eight defects and names the first corpus check as what found
            them. A ninth was found afterwards, by the first run of the workflow rather than by
            that check, and it is not in the count.
What:       the Merge section's "CI green before merge. That is the only condition." and done
            condition 2 are both written against a CI that exists, while `tools/ci.*` is built
            at 0.4. As stated, no checkpoint from 0.0 to 0.3 could merge or be declared done,
            so the corpus forbade the four checkpoints that build its own verification
            machinery. Both passages now name when they begin.
Measured:   the first workflow run, over 3 jobs on 3 runners, windows-latest, macos-latest and
            ubuntu-latest. All 3 ran, all 3 failed, and each failed on the missing `tools/ci.*`
            and on nothing else. `setup-dotnet` passed on all 3 before the failing step, which
            is what proves `global.json`'s 10.0.3xx band resolves on every runner and not only
            on this machine.
Notes:      this is the value of moving the workflow, arriving within the hour. Nothing about
            the merge rule was visible until a run existed to be red.

### 0.1 - the solution                                                       2026-09-06
Built:      `EquityBrief.sln` and the six projects the layout block names. `EquityBrief.Core`,
            `EquityBrief.Data` and `EquityBrief.Web` are libraries with no code yet;
            `EquityBrief.Api` is the one web application, mapping nothing, because the read
            surface is 1.5 and its done condition is that the API computes and fetches nothing;
            `EquityBrief.Worker` is a console command rather than a service, because scheduling
            lives outside the application. Three checks: `api-isolation`,
            `build-properties-central` and `pinned-constants`, the last covering the framework
            version and the SDK feature band, which 0.0 introduced into the specs and nothing
            guarded.
Measured:   over the 6 project files, 0 declare a target framework or a warning setting of
            their own, and `src/Directory.Build.props` declares the framework, nullable and
            warnings as errors. `EquityBrief.Api`'s compiled dependency file lists 4 libraries
            and `EquityBrief.Worker` is not among them; `EquityBrief.Tests`'s lists 6 and it is,
            which is what proves the check can fail rather than a string written to be caught.
            Over the 33 tracked files, 0 are unnamed by the layout block, the banned string
            appears once and it is the exempt line, and there are 0 em dashes. Over the 14
            decision citations in the 8 corpus documents and the 6 code and project files, 0
            fail to resolve apart from the placeholder already carried to 0.4. `dotnet build`
            over the solution reports 0 warnings and 0 errors.
Tests:      11, all passing, on Windows only. `tools/ci.*` does not exist until 0.4, so this
            was `dotnet test EquityBrief.sln` run by hand and nothing guards it yet. 5 of the 11
            exist to prove the other checks can fail: 1 for `api-isolation`, 1 for
            `build-properties-central`, and 3 for `pinned-constants` including one asserting
            that a version which cannot be read throws rather than defaulting.
Carried:    the suite unrun on macOS, due at 0.4. 0.1's checks unseen by the harness, due at
            0.7. The phase report named twice, due at 0.5. All three are rows in
            `BUILD_PLAN.md`'s carried obligations table.
Amended:    this checkpoint amends its own done condition. Done condition 5, the suite passing
            on both runners, is asserted by the matrix, the matrix calls `tools/ci.*`, and those
            arrive at 0.4, so no checkpoint from 0.1 to 0.3 could satisfy it. It now names 0.4
            as where it begins, which is the repair 0.0 made to the Merge section and to done
            condition 2 and missed here. The amendment and the checkpoint it lets through are in
            the same pull request, which is the thing this line exists to mark.
Notes:      the .NET 10 SDK writes `.slnx` by default and the corpus names `EquityBrief.sln`, so
            the solution was created with `--format sln` rather than the corpus amended to suit
            a tool default. `EquityBrief.Api` answers 404 from a host with no endpoints mapped,
            which is what was taken as evidence it runs. The component catalogue in
            `ARCHITECTURE.html` has the verification harness write `verify.html` and
            `verify.json` while `CLAUDE.md` and `BUILD_PLAN.md` say `artifacts/phase-report.*`;
            that is the third carried row and it is a corpus defect, not a 0.1 one.
