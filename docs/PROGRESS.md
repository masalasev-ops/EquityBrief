# PROGRESS.md

The record of what was built, what was measured, and what is carried. Append only. A correction is a new dated entry naming what it corrects, never an edit to an earlier one.

**Which checkpoint the build is on is the furthest checkpoint this file records.** The one to build next is the checkpoint after it in `BUILD_PLAN.md`.

An entry that belongs to a checkpoint without saying that checkpoint has landed opens with **"Not a checkpoint entry"**. A phase-planning pass is the usual case.

## Entry format

```
### <checkpoint> - <what it built>            YYYY-MM-DD
Built:      what exists now that did not before
Measured:   figures, each naming the population it was computed over
Tests:      the count after tools/ci
Carried:    obligations created here, each naming a due point BUILD_PLAN also has
Notes:      anything a later session would otherwise have to rediscover
```

**Every figure states the population it was computed over, in the same breath.** A figure over a mixed population is not stated at all. A count over listed names only is a figure over the wrong population, because a listing row exists for every name.

**A checkpoint that amended its own done condition says so here, in those words.**
