# PROGRESS.md

The record of what was built, what was measured, and what is carried. Append only. A correction is a new dated entry naming what it corrects, never an edit to an earlier one.

**Which checkpoint the build is on is the furthest checkpoint this file records.** The one to build next is the checkpoint after it in `BUILD_PLAN.md`.

An entry that belongs to a checkpoint without saying that checkpoint has landed opens with **"Not a checkpoint entry"**. A phase-planning pass is the usual case.

## Entry format

```
### <checkpoint> - <what it built>            YYYY-MM-DD
Built:      what exists now that did not before
Measured:   figures, each naming the population it was computed over
Tests:      the count after tools/ci
Carried:    obligations created here, each naming a due point BUILD_PLAN also has
Notes:      anything a later session would otherwise have to rediscover
```

**Every figure states the population it was computed over, in the same breath.** A figure over a mixed population is not stated at all. A count over listed names only is a figure over the wrong population, because a listing row exists for every name.

**A checkpoint that amended its own done condition says so here, in those words.**

### 0.0 - the repository, and eight defects the first corpus check found      2026-09-06
Built:      a git repository on `main`, the corpus committed unedited as its first commit, and
            branch `phase-0-repair` carrying the repairs. `ci.yml` moved from the root to
            `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, where Actions actually reads it. `global.json` and
            `src/Directory.Build.props` created. Checkpoint 0.0 added to `BUILD_PLAN.md`,
            `banned-prose` added to the Checks roster.
Measured:   over the 8 corpus documents, 13 decision citations, 0 unresolved and 0 resolving
            into "Previously decided". Over `DECISIONS.md`, 83 decision names, 7 of them
            previously decided, 0 duplicated, 0 carrying terminal punctuation. Over the 14
            tracked files, 0 unnamed by the layout block, 1 occurrence of the banned string
            and it is the exempt line, and 0 em dashes. Over `CHANGELOG.md`, 11 entries, 10
            naming a defect and 1 naming a decision, 0 naming neither. Over the 10 commits on
            this branch, 4 deleted a line from a spec and all 4 changed `CHANGELOG.md`.
Tests:      none. `tools/ci.*` does not exist until 0.4, so every figure above was swept by
            hand and none of it is guarded yet. A repeat of this sweep is what 0.4 automates.
Carried:    the citation placeholder in `BUILD_PLAN.md`'s carried obligations table, due at
            0.4, recorded as a row in that table.
Notes:      the workflow at the repository root was the sharpest of the eight. Actions reads
            workflows from `.github/workflows` and nowhere else, so the matrix job and the
            Linux case-sensitivity job had never run, which left done condition 5,
            `two-platform` and the instrument the Checks section claims for `path-casing` all
            unsatisfied with nothing reporting it. Neither is proved yet: no push has run the
            workflow, so 0.1 is the first checkpoint that will see either runner go green.
            `.claude/` is gitignored and untracked. It is per-machine harness state, not a
            corpus document, and the layout block does not name it.
