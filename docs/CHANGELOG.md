# CHANGELOG.md

The prior text of every clean edit to a spec. `changelog-reconciles` reads the git history and fails any commit that deleted a line from a spec without changing this file.

Specs are `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.html`, `SCHEMA.md`, `BUILD_PLAN.md` and `RUNBOOK.md`. Records correct themselves with new dated entries and do not appear here.

Nothing in the corpus is struck through. A spec is edited cleanly and what it said before is written down here, with the decision that authorised the change or the defect it repairs.

## Entry format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD - <file> - <what changed>
Authorised by: <a decision name, cited exactly>   OR
Corrects: <the defect, in one line, and how it was found>
Was:
> the prior text, verbatim
Now:
> the replacing text, or a note that the passage was removed
Why: one or two sentences
```

An entry names one or the other and never neither. A change that alters what the corpus decides cites the decision that authorises it; a change that repairs a spec which was wrong when written names the defect, because there was no decision to make and inventing one to fill the field would make the field unreadable.

## Entries

### 2026-09-05 - ARCHITECTURE.html - decisions moved out of the document
Authorised by: Facts are declared once and cited by descriptive name

Was: sections 21 and 22 of the architecture held the decisions and the previously-decided list inline, seventy-nine entries in all.

Now: both sections are replaced by a pointer to `DECISIONS.md`, which holds them as the record.

Why: the corpus keeps one place per fact. A decision stated in the architecture and again in a register is two documents holding one fact, and one of them always loses. The architecture cites decisions by name and `decision-resolves` asserts every citation against this record.

### 2026-09-06 - CHANGELOG.md - an entry may name a defect instead of a decision
Corrects: the entry format required every entry to name an authorising decision, and a defect correction has none. Found while preparing this pass, six of whose eight entries are defect corrections and would all have had to cite one catch-all decision, after which the field would have stopped meaning anything.
Was:
> Nothing in the corpus is struck through. A spec is edited cleanly and what it said before is written down here, with the decision that authorised the change.

> Authorised by: <the decision name, cited exactly>
Now:
> Nothing in the corpus is struck through. A spec is edited cleanly and what it said before is written down here, with the decision that authorised the change or the defect it repairs.

> Authorised by: <a decision name, cited exactly>   OR
> Corrects: <the defect, in one line, and how it was found>

with the paragraph beneath the format block saying an entry names one or the other and never neither.
Why: a field every entry fills with the same placeholder is a field nobody reads. Separating the two kinds keeps a decision citation meaning that a decision was made, which is what `decision-resolves` and `no-superseded-citation` are built to check.

### 2026-09-06 - BUILD_PLAN.md - checkpoint 0.0, the repository, inserted before 0.1
Corrects: the plan opened at 0.1 and no checkpoint owned creating the git repository. Found by the first corpus check, which looked for `.git` because `changelog-reconciles` reads the history and found no repository at all.
Was:
> the phase 0 checkpoint list began at 0.1, The solution.
Now:
> 0.0, The repository, precedes it, with the corpus committed unedited as the first commit.
Why: three rules the corpus already states depend on a repository existing, and a dependency nothing owns is one every session assumes somebody else did.
